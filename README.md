# PesaPal API Integration

### By Joanne Gitari 

## Description
This API allows you to get the Pesapal iframe URL by consuming the Pesapal API v3.0. It authenticates using JWT Tokens.

## Setup Requirements

* Git
* Github
* Python
* FastAPI
* PesaPal API v3.0

## Setup Installation

* Copy this repository's link üåê
```
https://github.com/joeygitari/pesapal-api-integration
```
* Clone it to your local machine üíª
```
$ git clone https://github.com/joeygitari/pesapal-api-integration.git
```
* Open your terminal and navigate to the directory of the project üìÅ
```
$ cd pesapal-api-integration
```
* Follow the documentation below üìë
```
https://developer.pesapal.com/how-to-integrate/api-30-json/api-reference
```
* Run the following commands to install the required dependencies.
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the project directory and add the following variables
```
CONSUMER_KEY=your-pesapal-consumer-key
CONSUMER_SECRET=your-pesapal-consumer-secret
```

## Usage
* Start the FastAPI server
```
$ uvicorn main:app --reload
```
* Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access the application.

* Authenticate and obtain an access token:
Send a POST request to /login with the following request body:
```
{
  "username": "test",
  "password": "test"
}
```
This will return an access token that you can use for further requests.
* Retrieve an access token from Pesapal:
Send a GET request to / to retrieve an access token from Pesapal. The response will include the access token if the request is successful.

* Register an IPN URL:
Send a GET request to /ipnUrl to register an IPN URL with Pesapal. This will return the registered IPN URL and other relevant information.

* Submit a payment order:
Send a GET request to /submitOrder to submit a payment order to Pesapal. This endpoint requires authentication with a valid access token obtained in step 3. The response will include the status of the submitted order.

## Configuration
* The application uses environment variables for configuration. 
You can set these variables in the .env file as mentioned in the installation steps. 
The available configuration options are:
```
CONSUMER_KEY: Your Pesapal API consumer key.
CONSUMER_SECRET: Your Pesapal API consumer secret.
```

## Security 
The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. 
The /login endpoint generates an access token, which must be included in the Authorization header as a bearer token for authenticated requests.
